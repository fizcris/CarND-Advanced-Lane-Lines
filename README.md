In this project, your goal is to write a software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video.


The Project
---

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

Note that all the notebooks need the helper functions script `0. Functions_Clases Pipeline.py` that is auto generated by the notebook `0. Functions_Clases Pipeline.ipynb` when it is executed. All the requirements to run the notebooks should be in the `pickle_data` folder. This project uses picke files wich is a way to pass data from notebook to notebook.

# 1. Camera calibration

The code for this section is contained in the Jupyter notebook `1. Camera Calibration Parameters.ipynb`.



The notebook starts by preparing the "object points", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. 

An asumption is made that the board is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image. Thus, objp is just a replicated array of coordinates, and objpoints will be appended with a copy of it every time it successfully detects all chessboard corners in a test image. imgpoints will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection.

The objpoints and imgpoints were then used to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera() ` function. The chessboard size was set to 9x6 for the project. 


Distortion correction was then applied to test images using the `cv2.undistort()` function with the following results:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Original image</p>
            <img src="report_resources/cal_images.gif" alt="cal_images" width="500" />
        </td>
        <td>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Undistorted image</p>
            <img src="report_resources/und_cal_images.gif" alt="und_cal_images" width="500" />
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>



## Notebook output:    
+ Calibration images with chessboard overdrawn
+ Undistorted calibtration images with chessboard overdrawn
+ Pickle file with camera calibration parameters `camera_calibration_params.p`.
  
# 2. Image undistortion
The code for this section is contained in the Jupyter notebook `2. Image undistortion.ipynb`. 

It is possible t test that the undistortion is working by checking the closer images where it can be detected a falt line insted of a concave line at the bottom side of the paper. See image below.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Original image</p>
            <img src="output_images/cal_images_12.jpg" alt="cal_images" width="500" />
        </td>
        <td>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Undistorted image</p>
            <img src="output_images/undistorted_cal_images_12.jpg" alt="und_cal_images" width="500" />
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

As we can see in the images below, the differences are quite subtle, althought present in every image. The further the pixels are from the center, the more distortion is appreciated. 

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Original image</p>
            <img src="report_resources/test_images.gif" alt="cal_images" width="500" />
        </td>
        <td>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Undistorted image</p>
            <img src="report_resources/und_images.gif" alt="und_cal_images" width="500" />
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

## Notebook output:    
+ Undistorted test images
+ Pickle file with original test images `test_images.p`
+ Pickle file with undistorted test images `undistorted_images.p`

# 3. Color enhancement and filtering
The code for this section is contained in the Jupyter notebook `3. Color Enhancement.ipynb`. 

Firstly images/frames are converted to HSL and then filtered for white an lleyow with the helper function `colorEnhancement(img)`

The mask filters for white and lleyow are created by appliyig the following range filters:

```
# Yellow mask range
color1_hls = (70, 120, 0)
color2_hls = (100, 255, 255)

#White mask range
color1_hls_w = (0, 220, 0)
color2_hls_w = (180, 255, 255)
```

Finally bitwise operations are performed in order to extract pixels presents in any of both masks.

Then the image is converted form HSL to gray scale and a gaussian blur operation with a kernel of 5x5  is performed over the images. The results are presented below.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <p style="text-align: center;">HSL filtering</p>
            <img src="report_resources/hsl_images.gif" alt="cal_images" width="500" />
        </td>
        <td>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Gray scale + Gaussian smoothing</p>
            <img src="report_resources/gauss_imgs.gif" alt="und_cal_images" width="500" />
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>


## Notebook output:    
+ Binary images ready for edge detection `gauss_images.p`
+ HLS filtered images
+ Gauss smoothed grayscale images



# 4. Edge detection
The code for this section is contained in the Jupyter notebook `4. Edge detection.ipynb`. 

The output of the gaussias smoothing passes then over a custom made sobel edge detector `sobel_thresh(img, sobel_kernel=3, x_thresh=[1,255], y_thresh=[1,255], mag_thresh=[1,255], dir_thresh=[-np.pi/2, np.pi/2])
`

To start width the sobel operators uses a fixed **sobel kernel of size 3** for our project, that mean that we will be using 3x3 matrices when applying the operator.

The detector function applies four techniques for edge detenction. It calculates the gradient along the x axis (values increasing from left to tight, edges closes to the vertical), the y axis (values increasing from top to bottom, horizontal lines), then the sobelx and the sobely are combined into a third magnitude operator and a direction operator. Range values of minimum and maximum can be applied to each operator.

The result is obtained in the following form after applying the indicated thresholds: `result = (sobelx and sobely) or (sobelmag and sobeldir)`. The limits of each thershold are stated in the function as default values.

The results are aceptable, as we can see the lines ar thicker and better defined, although the noise got also increased:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <p style="text-align: center;">W/O Threshold</p>
            <img src="report_resources/gauss_imgs.gif" alt="cal_images" width="500" />
        </td>
        <td>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Custom Sobel threshold</p>
            <img src="report_resources/sobel_images.gif" alt="und_cal_images" width="500" />
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>



Note that the images were converted to 8bit integers in order to work with a standarized integer format.

## Notebook output:    
+ Images with sobel filter applied

# 5. Region of interest masking
The code for this section is contained in the Jupyter notebook `5. Region of interest.ipynb`. 

A region of interest binary is applied in an attempt to filter out irrelevant feeatures for line detection. A four side polygon is employed and it can be parametrized with the following hyperparameters:

```
ROI_upperWidth = 300 #Width of the upper horizontal straight in px
ROI_upperHeight = 300 #Height of the upper horizontal straight from the bottom of the image in px
ROI_lowerWidth = 950 #Width of the lower horizontal straight in px
ROI_lowerHeight = 50  #Height of the lower horizontal straight  from the bottom of the image in px    
```

        <td>
